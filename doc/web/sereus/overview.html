<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Sereus is a Web3 fabric where identities and permissions are scoped to consent-based threads. Each thread is a shared SQL database among its participants with role-based access.</p>

<ul>
  <li>No global identity leakage; only thread participants see each other.</li>
  <li>Invite/consent flows form trusted subnets, not public broadcast.</li>
  <li>Data lives in shared SQL, replicated across participants' cadres.</li>
</ul>
