<h1>Use Case: Medical Records</h1>
<p>Patients own their medical thread. Providers gain scoped access by QR or invite; data shards across more nodes as providers join, improving availability while keeping control with the patient.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single patient-owned record; provider access is revocable.</li>
  <li>Role-based access to protect sensitive fields.</li>
  <li>Resilient storage via cadres and sharding.</li>
</ul>
