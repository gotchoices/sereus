<h1>Use Case: Digital Currency</h1>
<p>MyCHIPs historically used dual-party databases for shared tallies. On Sereus, tallies live in a thread, simplifying consensus and application logic by delegating storage concerns to the fabric.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shared SQL with clear roles and permissions.</li>
  <li>Reduced consensus complexity; simpler app layer.</li>
  <li>Interoperable with other thread-based services.</li>
</ul>
