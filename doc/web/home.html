  <h2>What is Sereus?</h2>
  <p><em>Sereus</em> (from Latin <em>serere</em>: to join, weave, connect) is a Web3 programming environment where connections (threads) are established between users by common consent and based on existing trust. Unlike traditional web identities that broadcast to the world, Sereus nodes join small, private subnets by invitation only.</p>
  <p>Each thread is a shared SQL database, accessible only by its participants with role-based permissions. Identities are shared only among thread members, and credentials are exchanged out of band—eliminating the need for certificate authorities or central identity providers.</p>
  <p>Designed for mobile-first deployment, Sereus runs efficiently on phones and other resource-constrained devices, bringing peer-to-peer capabilities to everyday mobile users.</p>

  <h2>Why Sereus?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> No global identity directory. Your identity exists only within threads you've joined by consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct Peer Connections:</strong> Communicate directly via libp2p multiaddresses without central brokers or gatekeepers.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared SQL Databases:</strong> Each thread provides a familiar SQL interface, distributed across participants for resilience.</li>
    <li><strong>Developer Friendly:</strong> Build applications using standard SQL queries on top of a robust distributed foundation.</li>
    <li><strong>True Decentralization:</strong> No single point of control or failure. Even relay nodes can be privately operated.</li>
  </ul>
