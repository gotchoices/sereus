  <h2>A New Model for Web3 Connections</h2>
  <p>Sereus Fabric rethinks how users connect and share data on the web. Instead of broadcasting your identity to a global network, Sereus creates small, private strands—invitation-only subnets where connections form through mutual consent and existing trust.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Are Strands?</h2>
  <p>A strand is the fundamental building block of Sereus. It represents:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A trusted subnet:</strong> Strands connect two or more users who have explicitly consented to share a common space.</li>
    <li><strong>A shared SQL database:</strong> Each strand contains a database accessible by all participants, with access controlled by role-based permissions defined by the strand creator or group.</li>
    <li><strong>A privacy boundary:</strong> Identities are shared only among strand participants. There is no global identity registry or directory.</li>
    <li><strong>A collaboration space:</strong> Strand databases can contain any SQL schema, supporting diverse applications from messaging to complex business logic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Principles</h2>
  
  <h3>Consent-Based Identity</h3>
  <p>Unlike traditional web platforms where your identity is globally searchable, Sereus identities exist only within the context of specific strands. When you join a strand, you share your identity only with that strand's participants. No central authority tracks your presence or connections.</p>
  
  <h3>Out-of-Band Trust</h3>
  <p>Strands form based on existing knowledge or trust between participants. Credentials and initial connections are established out of band—perhaps through a QR code, an email, or an in-person exchange. This eliminates the need for certificate authorities or SSL-style trust hierarchies.</p>
  
  <h3>Shared Data, Distributed Storage</h3>
  <p>Each strand's database is distributed across a <strong>cohort</strong>—all the devices belonging to the strand's participants. Every user contributes their personal device cluster (their <strong>cadre</strong>) to the strand's cohort. Data is sharded and distributed across the cohort for resilience, and all participants see a consistent view of the data, with access controlled by their assigned roles within the strand.</p>
  
  <h3>Invitation-Only Joining</h3>
  <p>New members join strands only by invitation from existing participants. This creates a natural barrier against spam, unsolicited messages, and unwanted connections. You receive communications only from strands you've explicitly joined.</p>

  <h2>How It Differs from Traditional Web</h2>
  <p>Traditional web applications typically rely on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Central servers that broker all connections</li>
    <li>Global identity systems (usernames, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
    <li>Platform owners who control access and data</li>
    <li>Certificate authorities to establish trust</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Sereus replaces this model with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Direct peer-to-peer connections via libp2p</li>
    <li>Strand-scoped identities known only to participants</li>
    <li>User-owned data distributed across trusted devices</li>
    <li>Out-of-band trust establishment without central authorities</li>
  </ul>
