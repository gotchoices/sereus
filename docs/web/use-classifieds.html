<h1>Use Case: Classifieds, Auctions & E-Commerce</h1>

<section>
  <h2>The Centralization Problem</h2>
  <p>In addition to building a private social media timeline, a user (or company) might want to build a for-sale space—a place to list goods or services for potential buyers. However, simply listing items on an unknown page somewhere on the Internet isn't useful. The critical challenge is: <strong>how do buyers find your listings?</strong></p>
  
  <h3>The Current Marketplace Landscape</h3>
  <p>Current web topology heavily favors centralization around a few large players:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shoppers for new goods go to <strong>Amazon</strong> because they know so many sellers list there</li>
    <li>Shoppers for used goods go to <strong>eBay</strong> for the same reason</li>
    <li>Other centralized services (like <strong>Facebook Marketplace</strong>) are making significant inroads</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This creates several problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Platform fees:</strong> Sellers pay significant percentages to the platform</li>
    <li><strong>Platform control:</strong> Your listings can be removed or demoted at the platform's discretion</li>
    <li><strong>Biased search:</strong> A Google search doesn't always yield the items you need, but rather the items being most aggressively advertised to you</li>
    <li><strong>Lock-in:</strong> Your reputation and transaction history are trapped within each platform</li>
    <li><strong>No neutrality:</strong> Platforms favor their own interests and advertisers over optimal buyer-seller matches</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Sereus Alternative: Neutral Ground</h2>
  <p>Sereus Fabric offers a neutral foundation where multiple commercial services can operate, each selling specialized services such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Publicity:</strong> Services that ensure buyers will find your goods and services</li>
    <li><strong>Indexes:</strong> Search services that help shoppers find what they need</li>
    <li><strong>Shipping:</strong> Services that guarantee delivery of purchased goods</li>
    <li><strong>Escrow:</strong> Services that ensure payment happens only when goods/services are rendered</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Crucially, sellers and buyers <strong>choose their own service providers</strong> for each function, based on reputation and preference. They're not locked into a single platform's bundled offerings.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  
  <h3>Decoupled Services</h3>
  <p>In the Sereus model:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A seller can use the <strong>publicity service</strong> of their choice</li>
    <li>A buyer can use the <strong>search service</strong> of their choice</li>
    <li>Both will still find each other, because these services work on a neutral foundation</li>
    <li>Services like shipping and escrow can be chosen by mutual consent based on reputation</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Portable Trust and Reputation</h3>
  <p>Rather than reputation being locked into a single platform:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sellers build reputation across transactions in different venues</li>
    <li>Buyers can reference a seller's transaction history across services</li>
    <li>Reputation services can compete on fairness and accuracy</li>
    <li>Trust is portable and not controlled by a platform</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Strand-Based Transactions</h3>
  <p>Each transaction might involve several strands:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Listing strand:</strong> Seller publishes item details; publicity service makes it discoverable</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction strand:</strong> Buyer and seller create a shared strand to negotiate terms</li>
    <li><strong>Escrow strand:</strong> Buyer, seller, and escrow service share a strand to manage payment</li>
    <li><strong>Shipping strand:</strong> Buyer, seller, and shipper coordinate delivery</li>
    <li><strong>Reputation strand:</strong> Transaction outcome is recorded for future reference</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Advantages Over Platform Marketplaces</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No platform rent:</strong> Service providers compete on value, not platform monopoly</li>
    <li><strong>Buyer-seller direct connection:</strong> Once connected through search, parties communicate peer-to-peer</li>
    <li><strong>Service flexibility:</strong> Choose publicity, search, shipping, and escrow independently</li>
    <li><strong>Portable reputation:</strong> Your transaction history isn't trapped in a single platform</li>
    <li><strong>Neutral search:</strong> Search services compete on relevance, not advertiser revenue</li>
    <li><strong>No arbitrary delistings:</strong> Platforms can't unilaterally remove your listings or ban your account</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy options:</strong> Transactions can be as public or private as participants choose</li>
    <li><strong>Fair competition:</strong> New service providers can enter the market without platform permission</li>
  </ul>
