## Packages

This folder contains **publishable Sereus libraries** (TypeScript packages) used by applications and other Sereus components.

Notes:
- Packages are kept separate from `../ops/` (how to run services) and `../docs/` (design/protocol docs).
- Current: `strand-proto/` (published as `@sereus/strand-proto`).
